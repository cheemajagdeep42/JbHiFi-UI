# 🌦️ JbHiFi - Weather Forecast Application (UI)

This is the **front-end** of the **Weather Forecast App**, built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Jest**.  
It consumes a **.NET backend API** to fetch live weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
---

## How To Run This Application on Local
1. **Clone** this repository to your local.
2. **Install dependencies** using the command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Setup environment variables** by creating a `.env.local` file in the root folder:
    ```env
       NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
       NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=`local-fake-key-1`
    ```

    For **local development**, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` can be one of:
    - `local-fake-key-1`
    - `local-fake-key-2`
    - `local-fake-key-3`
    - `local-fake-key-4`
    - `local-fake-key-5`
    > ⚠️ **Note:** The backend only allows **5 requests per API key per hour**.
    >  On **PROD**, all API keys are stored securely in **AWS Systems Manager – Parameter Store**.

4. **Start the .NET backend on local** (Dockerized):
   Clone the backend repository and follow its instructions:
   📁 **Repo Link**: [weatherForecast-backEnd](https://github.com/cheemajagdeep42/weatherForecast-backEnd)
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

5. **Start the UI development server**:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


6. **Run unit tests**:
    ```
      npm run test
    ```

### ⚠️ API Key Strategy: Local vs Production
   ✅ Local Development - 
       We use fake API keys like local-fake-key-1 in .env.local to simulate frontend → backend calls without exposing real secrets.
       These keys are predefined and whitelisted in the backend config (appsettings.Development.json) to allow smooth local development and testing.
  🔒 Production
         In production, valid keys are stored securely in AWS Systems Manager (Parameter Store) and injected at runtime. These keys are not hardcoded or exposed.
  💡 Why Fake Keys?
         To let reviewers run the UI without setup friction, while keeping real credentials secure. The fake key lets your UI communicate with the backend, which then enforces key validation and rate limiting.

## ☁️ How To Run This Application on PROD
  - **CI/CD** is configured using **GitHub Actions**.
  - On every push to the `main` branch, the UI is deployed to:
     - AWS **S3** (static hosting)
     - and **PROD** domain:  
     🔗 [https://weatherreportinfo.com](https://weatherreportinfo.com)
  - Backend is deployed under the same domain (subdomain):  
    🔗 [https://api.weatherreportinfo.com](https://api.weatherreportinfo.com)
  - All secrets for backend and 3rd-party APIs ([OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org)) are managed in **AWS Systems Manager**.
---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The user enters a **city** and **country**.
2. The UI sends a request to the backend:
    ```http
    GET /api/weather/description?city={city}&country={country}
    ```

3. The request includes an **API key** in the header:
    ```
    X-API-Key: your-api-key
    ```

4. The backend:
    - Validates the API key
    - Applies **rate limiting** (max 5/hour per key)
    - Forwards the request to **OpenWeatherMap**

5. The backend responds with the weather description.

6. The UI displays the result or a friendly error.

##  Notes
- This project calls a **.NET API** running inside **Docker** (`http://localhost:5000`).
- The backend must be up and running for the UI to work locally.
- All API requests must include the `X-API-Key` header.
